Conny Blumhardt, founder and publisher of the [Roast Magazine](https://roastmagazine.com/), started her [editorial for the March \| April 2022 edition of ROAST](https://roastmagazine.com/currentissue/fromthepublisher.html) with the words *"Standardâ€™ is one of those words that changes meaning based on the context it is used"*.

We are very thankful to ROAST for the opportunity to report on [NORM ROAST](https://norm-roast.org/), an open standard for determining the levels of pollutants, CO2 emissions and energy consumption of small to mid-size batch coffee roasting machines.

This feature article is currently available [online with free access](https://roastmagazine.com/currentissue/Roast_Feature_NORMROAST.html).
