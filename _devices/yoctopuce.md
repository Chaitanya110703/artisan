Artisan supports most Yoctopuce modules. Most prominently the Yocto Thermocouple and the Yocto PT100. Both connect directly via USB and do not need the installation of any additional driver. 

Artisan can access Yoctopuce devices connected to a [VirtualHub](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/virtualhub.php) from remote via a network connection, via the [YoctoHub-Ethernet](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/extensions-and-networking/yoctohub-ethernet), a [YoctoHub-Wireless](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/extensions-and-networking/yoctohub-wireless-n) hub or any other [Yoctopuce networking extension](http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/category/extensions-and-networking). Just enter the IP address of the virtual hub under menu `Config >> Device, Yoctopuce tab`. 

Yoctopuce devices can be configured and tested using the [VirtualHub](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/virtualhub.php).

## [Yocto Thermocouple](http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-environmental-sensors/yocto-thermocouple)

The Yocto Thermocouple offers two TC inputs supporting  J, K, E, N, R, S and T type thermocouples.

## [Yocto PT100](http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-environmental-sensors/yocto-pt100)

The Yocto-PT100 can be used with PT100 probes using 2, 3 or 4 wires. The type of connection is setup in software. To reach the highest precision, a 4-wires probe should be used. 3-wires probes are reasonably precise and not too much affected by wire lengths, contrarily to 2-wires probes which are the least precise and very sensitive to wire length. 

The Yocto-PT100 features a built-in galvanic isolation between the USB control part and the PT100 measure circuit. It is therefore possible to use non-isolated PT100 probes, which are often more reactive and less expensive.


## [Yoctopuce Temperature IR](http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/category/usb-environmental-sensors)

The Yocto IR module features an infrared sensor and communicates as all other Yocto modules via a fast USB connection. The Emissivity factor of the material observed can be configured for this sensor under menu ```Config >> Device```, in the ```Yoctopuce``` tab.


## [Yoctopuce Meteo](http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-environmental-sensors/yocto-meteo-v2)

The two channel Yocto-4-20mA-Rx device lets you read values returned by any industrial sensor following the 4-20mA standard. Artisan usess the Yoctopuce GenericSensor API to fetch data from this device.

## [Yoctopuce Yocto-Serial](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-electrical-interfaces/yocto-serial)

The Yocto-Serial module can autonomously interpret serial data coming from any external serial board. Artisan usess the Yoctopuce GenericSensor API to fetch data from this device.

## [Yoctopuce milliVolt-Rx](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-electrical-sensors/yocto-millivolt-rx)

The miliVolt-Rx module lets you measure by USB very small voltages (down to a few dozen of microVolts, and up to 2V max), even when they are generated by extremely weak sources (very high impedance). Artisan usess the Yoctopuce GenericSensor API to fetch data from this device.

## [Yoctopuce 0-10V-Rx](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-electrical-sensors/yocto-0-10v-rx)

*(support for this module is available in Artisan v2.8.2 and later)*

The Yocto-Watt is a digital watt-meter allows to monitor the power consumption of electrical devices. It measures voltage, current, power, and performs power integration on an electric connection.

The Yocto-Watt is supported by Artisan with the following device types.

- `Yocto Power`:
  - channel 1: reports the current power consumption (`currentValue`)
  - channel 2: reports the integrated power consumption over time (`meter`). Note that this counter is reset at each start of the device or via tha `Artisan IO Command` **`powerReset([,sn])`**.

- `Yocto Energy`:
  - channel 1: reports the delivered energy (`deliveredEnergyMeter`), maintained by integrating the power consumption over time when positive only. Note that this counter is reset at each start of the device or via tha `Artisan IO Command` **`powerReset(,sn])`**.
  - channel 2: reports the received energy (`receivedEnergyMeter `), maintained by integrating the power consumption over time when negative only. Note that this counter is reset at each start of the device or via tha `Artisan IO Command` **`powerReset([,sn])`**.

- `Yocto Voltage`:
  - channel 1: reports the DC voltage (`voltage1`)
  - channel 2: reports the AC voltage (`voltage2`)

- `Yocto Current`:
  - channel 1: reports the AC current (`current1`)
  - channel 2: reports the DC current (`current2`)

**Watch out!** 
`Yocto Energy` will bind to the first Yocto-Watt device only. All other device types support multiple Yocto-Watt devices.
