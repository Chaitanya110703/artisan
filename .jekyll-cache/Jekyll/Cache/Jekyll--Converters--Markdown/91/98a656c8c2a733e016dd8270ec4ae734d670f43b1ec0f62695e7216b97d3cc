<p>You will find many roaster manufacturers are now supporting Artisan.    See <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/machines/">Artisan Machines</a>.</p>

<p>Under Config&gt;Machine, you will find all the of the Machines with supported set ups.  The list has expanded greatly.  If after running setup you see, “uu” as the reading in the LCDs, something is not right. You should check your probes independent of Artisan first before you try to troubleshoot within Artisan.  So for example, with a Phidget, check the Phidget Control Panel which you will find after installing the Phidget drivers and make sure the Phidgets are updated and showing readings.</p>

<h3 id="configure-for-supported-devices">Configure for Supported Devices</h3>

<p>You will need to configure the hardware device taking the readings from the roaster if its not a listed roaster above.</p>

<p>Artisan supports various <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/devices/index">devices</a> for reading temperatures and other inputs such as air pressure and ambient conditions. Information on PID control can be found <a href="https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2016/11/pid-control.html">here</a>.  Additional devices can be configured on the Extra Devices tab of Config&gt;Devices.   A discussion of virtual devices and symbolic assignments is <a href="https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2014/04/virtual-devices-and-symbolic-assignments.html">here</a>. One potential symbolic assignment is for your bean temp, explained below, or the use of certain devices like an RTD Phidget.
Port settings are found under Config&gt;Port IF they are needed.</p>

<p>Artisan can now configure certain Phidgets much like a Machine. Machine setups for popular <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/devices/phidget-sets/">VINT Phidget sets</a>, available as ready-to-use packages from the Artisan shop, have been added that allow a one click configuration. There is a <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/phidgets/2x-tc-set/">2xTC setup based on the TMP1101</a>, a <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/phidgets/2x-rtd-set/">2xRTD low-noise setup based on two TMP1200</a> as featured in <a href="https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2019/03/on-idle-noise.html">On Idle Noise</a> using a <a href="https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2019/11/symbolic-formulas-basics-new-variables.html#one-in-two">one-in-two configuration</a>, and an <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/phidgets/ambient-extension/">ambient extension based on the PRE1000 &amp; HUM1000</a>. There is also a setup for the older Phidget 1048 “databridge”.  If you are using Phidgets, at the outset, make sure the probes are being read in the Phidgets Control Panels and then close the Panel before you hit ON in Artisan.</p>

<h3 id="configure-for-extra-devices-beyond-two">Configure for Extra Devices Beyond Two</h3>

<p>Artisan supports two primary devices for BT and ET, and you can add additional LCDs and Curves by using Extra Devices on the Cofig&gt;Devices tab.  Each physical device can have two channels, so on that tab you first select your device by its name in the drop down.  You pick a color for the display, apply a label/name for the device, add a formula to be applied to the device reading if any, and select if LCDs or Curves will be displayed. If you check the delta box, that will map the device to the right hand axis scale (the RoR axis) instead of the temperature axis.</p>

<h3 id="configure-language-temps-and-sampling">Configure Language, Temps and Sampling</h3>

<p><em>Language and Temp C or F</em></p>

<p>Menu&gt;Config&gt;Temperature and Menu&gt;Config&gt;Language are where you go to choose your language and Celsius or Fahrenheit and switch between the two if you like.</p>

<p><em>Symbolic BT/ET</em></p>

<p>What BT and ET temperatures do you want as reference points?</p>

<p>Some roasters are just fine with the readings their machines put out from their thermocouples.  Each machine is different and each machine’s thermocouples are placed differently and read differently.  Learn your machine is something you will hear over and over.  That said are you happy with first crack being at 365° or do you want it to be at 390°?  In order to adjust your machine thermocouples to give you dry end or first crack at temps that people think they should be at, you can enter an adjustment under Config&gt;Device on the Tab – Symb ET/BT.  <img src="/assets/images/gsg/device assignment - symbolic bt.png" alt="symoblic bt" /></p>

<p>Also don’t expect these to match the PID in the roaster if the probes are in different places.</p>

<p>Do you have to do this? NO.    You will know your roaster best and these data points aren’t absolutes, they are just reference point.  Sight and smell and will tell you best when dry end and first crack happen.  Make sure to use a lower case “x” as an upper case won’t work.  If you see a reading of -1 in the temp LCD’s your formula may be incorrect.</p>

<p>Artisan is set up to read ET and BT, two devices.  If you need more devices, you can add them through Extra Devices.  In that dialog box, the Label refers to the Channel of the device.  Each is set up so an Extra Device can read two channels.  So Label 1 is the first channel and Label 2 is the second channel.  If you were for example, using ports 2 and 3 on a VintHub, then Label 1 would be for port 2 and Label 2 for port 3.  Also, please note, all HUB IO devices block two ports on your VintHub, but for the one that is named “HUB IO 0” that only blocks the port 0. As explained in the blog post, <a href="https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2019/11/symbolic-formulas-basics-new-variables.html">Symbolic Formulas: Basics, New Variables and Applications</a> section One in Two, you would use Extra Devices to add additional RTD’s for Phidgets since the TMP1200 only reads one RTD.  In addition, in the example below there is an Extra Device to read a Differential Air Pressure Sensor (Phidget 1136) which is plugged into the VintHub port 0, and to provide a formulaic curve for it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gsg/Extra%20Devices.png" alt="extra device" /></p>

<p>Symbolic formulas are very important and provided advanced features as described in the Artisan Blog post.</p>

<p><em>Sampling and Oversampling</em></p>

<p>The default for sampling is set to 3s.  For a Phidget device one second is possible, and Artisan 1.3 goes down to .5s now.  Oversampling will take two readings per interval and average them.  See the <a href="https://artisan-scope.org/docs/sampling/">Sampling</a> page for more details.</p>

<p>If you go below a 3s interval you will get a popup warning <img src="/assets/images/gsg/sampling interval warning.png" alt="interval warning" /></p>

<p>You can try it lower and see if your equipment can handle it.  There have been reports that if you go down to 1s sampling, do NOT check oversampling as it causes very jumpy lines.</p>

<p>NOTE <em>Unplug Your Laptop Before You Roast</em>
Note that for most people unless you have a USB isolator you need to unplug your computer when using Artisan or will get feedback loops that will create all sorts of crazy spikes in the graph.  If you are using a desktop I guess you need to get an isolator.</p>

<h3 id="settings--load-load-recent-save">Settings- Load, Load Recent, Save</h3>

<p>Menu&gt;Help&gt; is where you go to load and save settings.  Load Recent is a shortcut to settings you have recently used. You can use Artisan with more than roaster by saving two sets of settings and then using Load Recent to change between roasters.   <strong>Please save your settings on a regular basis with backups, especially if you use extra devices.</strong></p>

<h3 id="information-for-troubleshooting">Information for Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>Menu&gt;Help is a place you can find information on Errors, Messages from the program, a Serial log, search your settings, and information on the platform you are using.</p>

<h3 id="factory-reset">Factory Reset</h3>

<p>If you ever need to reset Artisan to factory settings, it’s under Menu&gt;Help&gt;Factory Reset.</p>
