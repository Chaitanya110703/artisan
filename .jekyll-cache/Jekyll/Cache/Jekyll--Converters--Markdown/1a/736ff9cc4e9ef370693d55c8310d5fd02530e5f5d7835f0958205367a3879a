<p>The default for sampling is set to 3s.  For a Phidget device one second is possible, and Artisan goes down to .5s.  Oversampling will take two readings per interval and average them.</p>

<p>If you go below a 3s interval you will get a popup warning <img src="/assets/images/gsg/sampling interval warning.png" alt="interval warning" /></p>

<p>but you can experiment and see what is best for you. You can try it lower and see if your equipment can handle it. If you go down to 1s or less sampling, and you check oversampling, make sure it doesnâ€™t cause graph lines that are to jumpy.</p>
