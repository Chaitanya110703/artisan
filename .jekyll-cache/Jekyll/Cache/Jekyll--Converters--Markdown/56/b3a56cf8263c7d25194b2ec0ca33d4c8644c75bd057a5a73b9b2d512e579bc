<p><em>Menu&gt;Tools&gt;Convert Profile Temperature</em></p>

<p>Sometimes you will want to convert your profiles from Fahrenheit to Celcius and vice versa, especially if you are sharing with others and trying to compare your roasts.  If you do that from the Tools menu, you will change the convert the existing profile immediately, and you will also change the mode of recording for your next roasts.</p>

<p>Here is the profile in Fahrenheit</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gsg/Convert to F.jpg" alt="Profile in F" /></p>

<p>And converted to Celcius</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gsg/Convert to C.jpg" alt="Convert to C" />
Now you can discuss a roast of similar beans with someone that has used a different temperature mode.</p>
