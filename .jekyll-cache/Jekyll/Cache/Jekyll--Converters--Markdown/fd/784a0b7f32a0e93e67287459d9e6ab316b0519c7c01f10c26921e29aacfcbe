I"X<p>The Arduino/TC4 (available on <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/greencardigan/tc4-arduino-shield-v602/">Tindi</a>)is an interesting option for those that do not worry much about handling electronics without a case. The TC4 is a 4-channel temperature probe shield that can be attached to the standard <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino UNO</a> open-hardware device. There is also an integrated product that combines a variant of the UNO with the TC4 in one package, named TC4C, as well as further variants like the <a href="https://coffee.gerstgrasser.net/">TC4+</a>. Furthermore, the HT Roaster Interface was developed as add on to the TC4/TC4C stack to allow the control of the <a href="http://www.hottopusa.com/">Hottop home roaster</a> via serial commands that can be assigned to sliders or buttons in Artisan (see <a href="http://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.de/2013/02/controlling-hottop.html">this post</a> for details).</p>

<p>Artisan implements the <a href="https://github.com/greencardigan/TC4-shield/blob/master/applications/Artisan/aArtisan/trunk/src/aArtisan/commands.txt">serial protocol</a> of the Arduino TC4/TC4C with PID support.</p>
