<p><em>Menu&gt;Tools&gt;Simulator</em></p>

<p>Choose the Simulator item under Tools and choose a roast profile to enter the simulation modus. In case a profile is already loaded, that profile is used as input for the simulation. Note that the simulator is not available in the Artisan Viewer.</p>

<p>Simulator allows you test features such as Extra Devices, LCD settings, talking events and a wide variety of settings by using a previous roast to simulate a current roast.  For example, if you use talking alarms, you may not get the syntax and other choices correct when setting up your events.  With Simulator you can run a test without actually roast.</p>

<p>When you choose Menu&gt;Tools&gt;Simulator a dialog will open to choose a roast.  Hit Start and off you go.</p>
