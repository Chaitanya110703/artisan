<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>The computer running Artisan must be on the same IP network as the roaster. The default IP address of the roaster is 192.168.2.32. Configure your computer to use a static IP address in the range of the roaster (192.168.2.x) but with x different from that of the roaster (eg. 192.168.2.42). Choose 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask.</p>

<p>This can be done on Windows using the Network Sharing Center by adding a TCP/IPv4 Local Area Connection with those properties. On macOS you set your ethernet port in the Network Control panel to ‚ÄúIPv4: Manually‚Äù and fill in the IP and subnet mask accordingly.</p>

<p class="notice--primary"><strong>Watch out!</strong> Artisan comes with two machine setups. The one named <em>RM legacy</em> works with older machines that return data without decimals while the one named <em>RM</em> works with the newer machines that return data with decimals.</p>

<p class="notice--primary"><strong>Watch out!</strong> Artisan doesn‚Äôt monitor unsafe temperatures, so you should never leave the roaster alone.</p>
