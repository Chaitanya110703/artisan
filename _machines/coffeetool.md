### Setup

The computer running Artisan must be on the same IP network as the Coffeetool roaster. Configure your computer to use a static IP address in the range of the roaster (192.168.1.x) but with x different from that of the roaster (which by default is 192.168.1.42). Choose for example 192.168.1.55. Set the subnet mask of your computers network setup to 255.255.255.0.
